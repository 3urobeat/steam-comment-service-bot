# Steam Limitations
[⬅️ Go back to wiki home](./#readme)

&nbsp;

Steam has some strict restrictions for commenting.  
This page attempts to explain what you can and cannot do with limited & unlimited accounts.  
Steam also has their own page [which you can view here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A).  

&nbsp;

**Steam Guard:**  
Most interactions in the community need you to have Steam Guard enabled, especially for commenting.  
Please make sure that all your bot accounts have at least E-Mail Steam Guard enabled.

&nbsp;

**What is a limited account?**  
Limited accounts are Steam accounts which have spent less than $5 USD on the Steam Store.  
They have stricter limitations and ratelimits to reduce the amount of spam and scams in the SteamCommunity.  

&nbsp;

If your account is **limited**, you can:
- ...comment on profiles of friends
- ...comment on sharedfiles (screenshots, artworks & guides)
- ...favorize and unfavorize sharedfiles

If your account is **unlimited**, you can do all of the above and additionally:
- ...comment on non-friend profiles
- ...comment in groups
- ...upvote and downvote sharedfiles
- ...add other users as friends

This list is not exhaustive, it just lists features supported by this bot.
