# Steam Limitations
Steam sadly has some strict restrictions for commenting.  
You can read all of them here: [Steam Support](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663)  

If you use *limited accounts* (spent <$5 on the Store) the user will need to send all of these bot accounts a friend request before requesting a comment!  

Please be also advised that in order to comment on a profile the accounts need to have at least **email steam guard** activated.  
There are generators out there that can directly generate accounts with steam guard, however it does not take long to do yourself if you'd like to avoid shady generators.
