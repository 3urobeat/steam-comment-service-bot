- Added support for setting specific games for specific accounts
- Added a language system which currently supports english & russian. Each user can set their lang using !lang
  - Reworked `customlang.json` structure to work with the new language system. Please read the updated [customlang wiki page](/docs/wiki/customlang_doc.md)!
- Added a relogging handler which also attempts to switch out broken proxies - you no longer need to manually intervene to get accounts back online!
  - The bot now longer stops itself when the main account looses connection
- Renamed `config.json` keys `commentdelay`, `commentcooldown`, `maxComments` & `maxOwnerComments` to `requestDelay`, `requestCooldown`, `maxRequests`, `maxOwnerRequests` to apply to all request types

&nbsp;

**Reworks:**
- Reworked `customlang.json` structure to work with the new language system. Please read the updated [customlang wiki page](/docs/wiki/customlang_doc.md)!
- Reworked how variables are set in language strings to easily distinguish them from normal text. They now follow this syntax: `${variableName}`
- Reworked how proxies are loaded and stored in the DataManager to store connection status information
  - They are now stored in an array of objects instead of a string array and contain the properties `proxy`, `proxyIndex`, `isOnline` & `lastOnlineCheck`
- Reworked how the logininfo is stored in the DataManager to fix an invalid account order when a username consisting of only numbers was provided
  - The accounts are now stored in an array of objects instead of an object with the username as key
- Reworked bot accounts password protection in `!eval`
- Reworked `advancedconfig.json` by adding dummy values that act as separators to group certain settings together
- Reworked Updater's `customUpdateRules()` to carry removed config & advancedconfig values through an update
  - The corresponding compatiblity feature must handle the processing & removal of these values
- Replaced all writeFile() calls with DataManager write helper calls
- Replaced every lang usage with `data.getLang()`
- Improved `!settings` command array & object conversion
- Improved log for first time user when installing dependencies
- Improved creating plugins, accounts setup and config setup guide
- The `controller.restart()` function now automatically sets default params if undefined to simplify usage
- DataManager's dataCheck now returns a string containing information when a config value has been reset to default
  - The `!settings` command now handles this setting change rejection by informing the user
- Generalized a few lang strings to make translation easier

&nbsp;

- Miscellaneous log improvements (e.g. less newlines, less messages without dates)
- Renamed `config.json` keys `commentdelay`, `commentcooldown`, `maxComments` & `maxOwnerComments` to `requestDelay`, `requestCooldown`, `maxRequests`, `maxOwnerRequests` to apply to all request types
- Renamed `advancedconfig.json` key `relogTimeout` to `loginRetryTimeout`. `relogTimeout` is now used in `handleRelog`.
