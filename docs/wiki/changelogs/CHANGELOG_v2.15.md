## **2024-03-03, Version 2.15.0**
**Changes of note (TL;DR):**  
- Added new commands: `!funnyvote`, `!jobs`
- Added support for commenting and voting on reviews and for commenting on eventcomments discussions
- Drastically decreased startup time for larger instances with many proxies by applying logindelay per proxy instead of per account
- Added QR-Code login
- Added a JobManager to group routinely executed functions in one place and allowing the registration and unregistration of jobs during runtime
- Added automatic plugin update on boot and `botVersion` parameter to check and warn of version mismatch

If you are using a `customlang.json`, make sure to read the language string changes at the end and update your file.  
If you've made a plugin, check the 'Creating Plugins' wiki page and add the `botVersion` parameter to your `package.json`.

**Reworks:**

  - Improved logging of login progress and online status events

- Improved translating chapter on contribution wiki page
- Improved errors_doc wiki page as it was pretty outdated
- Improved Setup Guide wiki page styling with markdown highlights
- Improved various JsDocs

&nbsp;

**Fixes:**
- Fixed new refreshToken not getting stored because event was not being handled
- Fixed plugins not being able to be installed without updating `fileStructure.json` by ignoring `package.json` in script
- Fixed player_name retrieval fail throwing error when user isn't cached when receiving or sending chat messages, e.g. immediately after accepting a friend request
- Fixed lang import failing when folder or only `english.json` is missing
- Fixed certain class props not being included in `types.d.ts` because a JsDoc was missing or incorrect
- Fixed `useradded` message being able to fail when sending too quickly after accepting friend request by delaying it by 2.5 seconds
- Fixed `!update` response messages being able to fail because accounts were logged off too fast by delaying initiateUpdate() call by 2.5 seconds
- Fixed incorrect command name `!vote` in help message by changing it to `!upvote`
- Fixed line number in dataImport quotes check warning message being wrongly offset by 1
- Fixed wrong/missing variable syntax in language strings associated to `!update` command
- Fixed wrong/missing variable syntax in `commentretrying` language string
- Fixed multiple "Already attempting to log on, cannot log on again" errors caused during login/relog, introduced by recent steam-user update

- Fixed CommandHandler's `runCommand()` throwing error when resInfo parameter was `undefined`
- De-duped strings in `quotes.txt` file

&nbsp;

**Changes:**
- All request types will now enforce maxRequest settings set in `config.json`. Previously only the comment command would enforce it.
- Improved up-/downvote ratingHistory database operations
- Improved missing accounts error message in vote and curatorFollow requests by returning specific nounlimited message
- Primary Group will now only be set if not already done. This does not reduce amount of requests (unless Steam weights requests differently and a editProfile request is heavier than a profile fetch) made but rather reduces log-noise
- Generalized requesttoohigh & commentnounlimitedaccs language strings to be used for all request types
- The dataIntegrity check is now getting executed slightly earlier on startup
- Updated `steam-comment-bot-template`, `steam-comment-bot-webserver`, `steam-comment-bot-discord-plugin` and `steam-comment-bot-rest` ([#7](https://github.com/DerDeathraven/steam-comment-bot-rest-api/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/DerDeathraven/steam-comment-bot-rest-api/pull/8)) to v2.15
  - Plugin `steam-comment-bot-webserver` is now shipped as a NPM registry package instead of as a locally packed one
- Updated russian translation by [@sashascurtu](https://github.com/sashascurtu) in [#235](https://github.com/3urobeat/steam-comment-service-bot/pull/235)
- Disabled now unused 32 bit int limit `requestDelay * maxRequests` startup check
- Updated wiki pages (config_doc, advancedconfig_doc, commands_doc, creating_plugins, steam_limitations, setup_guide) to accomodate changes made in this update
- Updated dependencies
- Minor other changes

<a id="2.15.2"></a>

## **2024-05-09, Version 2.15.2**
**Additions:**
- Added traditional chinese translation [@Tira-tw](https://github.com/Tira-tw) in [#242](https://github.com/3urobeat/steam-comment-service-bot/pull/242)
- Added !add alias to !addfriend command

- Added setting 'enableRelogOnLogOnSessionReplaced' to `advancedconfig.json` to control whether the bot should relog accounts that have lost their connection with the error 'LogOnSessionReplaced'. Default value is `true`. To retain the same behavior as previously, where the bot would skip those accounts, set the value to `false`.

- Fixed potential login softlock when account switches proxy while a login process is active, with that account queued in it

- Fixed 'userunfriend' & 'userforceunfriend' language strings being flipped internally

**Changes:**
- The bot will now always emit the ready event on the second login rerun even if POSTPONED accounts still exist
- Refactored some code to use the proper log prefix more consistently instead of sometimes switching to bot index
- Refactored some code to surround userIDs more consistently with quotation marks
- Refactored some code to simplify the unfriendall command
- Improved contributing page
- Improved issue templates
- Migrated eslint config for eslint v9 and added & enforced two more rules
- Updated hostname check
- Updated dependencies
