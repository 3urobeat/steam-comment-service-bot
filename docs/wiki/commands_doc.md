**Note about voting, favorizing & follow commands:**  
The bot only knows about accounts which have already voted/favorized/followed an item for requests that have been made through the bot.  
This is because all requests are stored in a database and we cannot ask Steam for every account on every request as this would spam the heck out of them.
