The plugin system loads plugin packages installed by the user, exposes the Controller and provides functions for managing plugin data.  
Plugins must be installed npm packages with the name prefix `steam-comment-bot-` to be recognized.

You can read more about plugin requirements and their files on the [Creating Plugins wiki page](../../wiki/creating_plugins.md).

Every function and object property is documented with JsDocs in the implementation file.
