**Features:**
* Request profile, group, screenshot, artwork, guide or discussion comments directly from the Steam Chat
* Manage hundreds of Steam accounts with ease and control them from **one** terminal and Steam Chat
* No need of having a Steam Client installed - perfect for hosting on a server
* Apply cooldowns to users and customize various settings (including multi language support!)
* Advertise your Steam group and automatically invite users to it
* Use proxies to spread requests over multiple IPs
* Completely VAC safe as it does not directly interact with any games
* Extend the bot's functionality with plugins
