## Steam Comment Bot Plugins
This application supports plugins in the form of npm packages. Proper documentation will follow.  

This folder holds folders for all your installed plugins, which contain a config and any data your plugin needs to save.  

You can also store locally packed `.tgz` packages here to install them via `npm install ./plugins/steam-comment-bot-myplugin-1.0.0.tgz` from the project root.  

To create your own plugin, follow the [Creating Plugins](../docs/wiki/creating_plugins.md) wiki page.
